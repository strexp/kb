# Welcome to Strategic Explorations Knowledgebase!

Strategic Explorations Network (referred to as StrExp Network) is a global network service provider formed by the merger of Strategic Explorations and Niantic Network in June 2020. The new StrExp Network inherits the entire infrastructure of the previous two networks and is dedicated to building backbone network services that span multiple distributed networks.

As of now, StrExp Network has dozens of direct peer-to-peer interconnections and provides traffic-bearing networks, as well as access to distributed networks such as DN42 and NeoNetwork, and has 12 PoPs around the world.

In addition to providing excellent stability and availability through advanced warning mechanisms, StrExp Network also actively uses experimental routing software and algorithms, and actively promotes the healthy development of various distributed networks.
